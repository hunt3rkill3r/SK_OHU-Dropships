# Issues:

- Return to parking seems to not trigger right now.
- Turrets cannot use ammo or they break, if player find it too op will probably need to increase turret costs or increase firing cooldown (curr at 2)
- Attacking a base seems to land you in the middle of the map, doesnt seem to be a way to change this, will look into it later. Meanwhile landing on the edge will likely render your turret useless, because its too far away from the action.

# Things to do (maybe):

- The Research for all ships is unified and very late game, will likely split this into earlier possiblities.
- Make some new ships and new weapons.
